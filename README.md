# Notes
Android app for saving notes or reminders.
The application allows:
* Adding a new reminder
* Deleting an already added reminder from the list
* Editing an already added reminder in the list

In the settings the user can save his username, e-mail and password.

#### Add a new reminder
We add a new reminder by clicking on the `<Take Note >` button. In the new reminder we can add: title, content and date. The date must be day / month / year.

#### Delete a reminder
We can delete the reminder by clicking on the reminder in the list on the home screen.

#### Edit reminders
We edit the reminder by pressing LongClick on one of the reminders in the list, and the editing activity opens.
